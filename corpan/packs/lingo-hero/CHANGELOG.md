# Changelog

All notable changes to the Lingo Hero pack are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- TTS now speaks the raw entry text instead of the display-cleaned label;
  display labels are cleaned separately and title-casing is restricted to
  Latin/ASCII text (foreign scripts are left intact).
- The quiz target language now follows the host's chosen languages
  (`getStackConfig().languages`) instead of always picking the first
  non-English translation, and updates live via `onStackConfigChange`.

### Added
- Premium UI/UX design system: cohesive glass/neon menu, in-game HUD, and
  game-over panel with juicy mode buttons (icons, sub-labels, hover/active
  glow), animated combo pulse, floating score deltas, a "New Best!" ribbon,
  and a progression-aware game-over summary (best streak / level / high score).
- Locally vendored fonts (`assets/fonts/*.woff2`, Lato under OFL-1.1) with
  `@font-face` in `styles.css`; removed the remote Google Fonts `@import` so
  the pack is fully offline-first. `'Russo One'` (used by the canvas renderer)
  is aliased to the vendored display weight.
- RTL layout mirroring driven by the active-language `isRTL` flag (logical CSS
  properties + `dir` on the UI layer), accessible focus-visible states, and a
  `prefers-reduced-motion` fallback.
- Typed event bus (`src/events.ts`) emitting `gameStart`, `menuShown`,
  `noteHit`, `noteMiss`, `comboChange`, `scoreChange`, `gameOver`.
- Stream seams (no-op): `effects/`, `audio/`, `progression/`, and a `Hud`
  class (`ui/Hud.ts`) that owns the DOM overlay.
- RTL awareness (`ar`/`he`/`fa`/`ur`) surfaced on the active-language context.
- First canvas paint is gated on `document.fonts.ready`.
