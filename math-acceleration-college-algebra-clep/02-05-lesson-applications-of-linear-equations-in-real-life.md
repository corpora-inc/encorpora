## Applications of Linear Equations in Real Life

Linear equations model many practical situations. In these examples, we will see how to construct and solve equations based on real-life scenarios. A linear equation has the form

$$
y = mx + b
$$

where:

- $m$ is the rate of change (slope).
- $b$ is the starting value (y-intercept).

We now present three clear examples.

### Example 1: Modeling a Cell Phone Plan

Consider a cell phone plan with a fixed monthly fee and a cost per minute of call time. Suppose the plan charges a $20 monthly fee and $0.15 for each minute used. The total monthly cost $C$ can be modeled by the equation:

$$
C = 0.15m + 20
$$

where $m$ is the number of minutes used. 

If a user talks for 100 minutes, substitute $m = 100$:

$$
C = 0.15(100) + 20
$$

Compute the value:

$$
C = 15 + 20 = 35
$$

Thus, the monthly cost is $35. This equation helps in planning usage or comparing different plans.

### Example 2: Calculating Distance Traveled at Constant Speed

When an object moves at a constant speed, the distance $d$ traveled is a linear function of time $t$. The relationship can be written as:

$$
d = vt
$$

where $v$ is the constant speed. 

For instance, if a car travels at a speed of 60 miles per hour, then after 3.5 hours, the distance is:

$$
d = 60(3.5)
$$

Multiply to find the distance:

$$
d = 210
$$

The car travels 210 miles. This linear model can be useful in planning trips or estimating travel time.

### Example 3: Temperature Conversion from Celsius to Fahrenheit

Temperature conversion between Celsius ($C$) and Fahrenheit ($F$) is a real-life application of a linear equation. The conversion formula is:

$$
F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32
$$

If the temperature is 25°C in Celsius, substitute $C = 25$:

$$
F = \frac{9}{5}(25) + 32
$$

First, compute the fraction:

$$
\frac{9}{5}(25) = 45
$$

Then add the constant:

$$
F = 45 + 32 = 77
$$

Thus, 25°C equals 77°F. This conversion is essential in science, engineering, and everyday weather forecasts.

> Key Insight: Linear equations not only describe mathematical relationships, but also provide a straightforward method to predict and analyze real-world outcomes by isolating the unknown quantity and solving systematically.

Each example demonstrates a linear relationship where one quantity changes at a constant rate relative to another. Understanding these models is key to applying algebra in various real-life contexts.
