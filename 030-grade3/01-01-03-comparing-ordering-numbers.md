### Comparing and Ordering Numbers

#### Understanding the Basics

Comparing numbers is an essential skill as it helps us make decisions based on numerical values.

#### Symbols Used in Comparison

There are three main symbols used to compare numbers:

- Greater than ($>$)
- Less than ($<$)
- Equal to ($=$)

Here are examples of how they are used:

- $5 < 9$ (5 is less than 9)
- $12 > 3$ (12 is greater than 3)
- $7 = 7$ (7 is equal to 7)

#### Real-World Example

Imagine you have two snack boxes. One box contains 15 chocolates and the other contains 18. To compare these, you calculate:

- 15 $<$ 18

This tells you the first box has fewer chocolates than the second.

#### Ordering Numbers

Ordering numbers means arranging them from the smallest to the largest (ascending order) or from the largest to the smallest (descending order).

- **Ascending Order:** $3, 7, 12, 25$
- **Descending Order:** $25, 12, 7, 3$

#### Steps to Compare and Order Numbers

1. **Comparing Two Numbers:**
    - Look at the highest place value (like hundreds, tens, ones) first.
    - Compare digits starting from the leftmost place. If they are the same, move to the next place.
    - Use the correct symbol ($<$ or $>$) to indicate which is greater or lesser.

2. **Ordering Several Numbers:**
    - Write down the numbers.
    - Compare each pair using place value.
    - Arrange them in the required order, either ascending or descending.

#### Practice Problems

1. Compare these pairs of numbers using $<$, $>$, or $=$.
    - $8$ ___ $10$
    - $45$ ___ $45$
    - $67$ ___ $76$

2. Arrange these numbers in ascending order: $14, 3, 9, 27$

3. Order these numbers in descending order: $43, 18, 25, 32$

#### Historical Context

The symbols for greater than and less than ($>$ and $<$) were introduced by Thomas Harriot, an English mathematician, in the 16th century. These symbols have made mathematical communication clearer and are now used worldwide.

#### Why It Matters

Comparing and ordering numbers is crucial in everyday activities such as shopping, where you compare prices, or in scheduling, where you arrange events by time. Understanding these concepts will help you make informed and efficient choices.
